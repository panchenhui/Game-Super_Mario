Specific comments on code quality:
The code quality of this class looks good. It's similiar to the LevelClass file, which only does the job of creating the new world. The code is readable and maintable.
The cohesion and coupling is acceptable, since not many variables were passed to this class. Also, it has a low dependency.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
If we want to add new type of items in the new world, then we could just add these items in the Update() method.
