Specific comments on code quality:
		Since the EEnemyCollisionHandler and ECollisionDetector just have one method, every varible will be used in the only method. Thus the cohesion of these two classes
	is high. On the other hand, both of the two classes use the Enum class. The Enum class could raise the coupling of the two classes but will not cause problems.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
		In the future, we can add new Enum types in the Enum class without influence on the EEnemyCollisionHandler and ECollisionDetector classes. The reusability of the Enum
	is pretty high.
