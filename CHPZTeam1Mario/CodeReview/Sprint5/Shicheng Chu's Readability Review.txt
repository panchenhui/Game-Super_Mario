Number of minutes taken to complete the review: 10mins
Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
		Yifei Zhao have written an Enum class to reduce magic numbers. Haoqi Hu and Yifei Zhao use enum to replace the magic number in EEnemyCollisionHandler and ECollisionDetector.
	Now the original integers like 1, 2, 3, 4 have become Enum.DisableMovementType.*** so others will easily understand what they mean. For example, Enum.DisableMovementType.Down
	means the movement to the downside will be disabled.
