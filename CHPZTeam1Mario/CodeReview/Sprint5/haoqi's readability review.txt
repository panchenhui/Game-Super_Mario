Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
Readable:
1. Easily understand method names.
2. Easily understand variable names. 
3. It is very good practice to use enums instead of the integers, which indicates the kinds of collision very clearly.  
4. Generally, the readability is good, the code is very easy to understand.
