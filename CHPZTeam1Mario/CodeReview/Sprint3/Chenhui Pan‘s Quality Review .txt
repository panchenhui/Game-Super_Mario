Name of the .cs file being reviewed: ControllerKeyBoard.cs

Specific comments on code quality:
The code is readable and maintable, each method is clear. It's high cohesion and low coupling. This class only does the actions that related to the keyboard.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
If the keys to control mario's movement are changed, then it's easy to implement this. We can just modify the Keyboard.Add() to support that change.
