Specific comments on code quality:
		For WorldManager.cs, its only purpose is to manage a Mario game world. Every filed and function are used to create, update and draw a Mario game world. Therefore,
		the cohesion for this class is high. However, it has used various classes such as Goomba, Koopa, and lists for enemy, item and blocks. Therefore, it is a tightly coupling
		class.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
		This WorldManager could only be used for this sprint. If we want to add new levels for Mario game, this WorldManager is useless and we must write a new worldManager.
		My solution is to write a interface named IWorldManager and every worldManager class must implememt this interface. It is convenient for us to create different worldManager
		of different level.
