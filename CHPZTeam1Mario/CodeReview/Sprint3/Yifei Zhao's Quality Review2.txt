MEnemyCollisionHandler.cs
Code Quality:
The overall quality of this class is good. The only method in the class takes 3 parameters and does operations on those 
parameters. Changing code in those parameters will not affect the collision handler. Thus, it has low coupling. This class
did its own job well and only did it own job. So it is in high cohesion. To maintain and reuse this class is relatively easy.

If some content is changed in this class, the only thing will happen is the behavior of collision objects. The game project
can deal with these changes.
