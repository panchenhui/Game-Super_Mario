WorldManager.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed:

Specific Comments on Code Quality:
1. Cohension and Coupling stuff are good. 
2. It could be simplified by introducing LevelClass into it.
Hypothesis:
If we use LevelClass in our code, we could move all the content of load, and 
update into LevelClass, and in WorldManager, we just need to use specific arrayList to
call the corressponding load, update method. This could simplify our code a lot.
