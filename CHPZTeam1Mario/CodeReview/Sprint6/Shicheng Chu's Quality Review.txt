Specific comments on code quality:
		The code quality of this class is good. In the beginning of this class, there is some public fields. It will be better if these
	fields can be reduced or change to private.But some of them are nessicessary. All the method do its job and only do its job. Thus
	the cohesion is high in this class. This code has good maintainability and reusability. 

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
		If something need to be changed in this class. The program can handle these changes since this class is only responsible for
	the behavior of BossPrincess object.
