Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
		The overall readability of this class is good. Some method is long but is under 25 lines. It takes some time to read but
	it is readable. There are some magic number in this class. Hopefully, in the future, the magic number problem can be
	fixed. The method name and variable name are reasonable.
