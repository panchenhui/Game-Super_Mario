Specific comments on code quality:
		In the Camera.cs, it has two variables--cameraPositionX and cameraPositionY. However, since the camera will not move up and down,
	the cameraPositionY is always 0. Therefore, the cameraPositionY is unnecessary or useless for the Camera.cs and other classes that use cameraPositionY
	(such as GoombaClass.cs, LevelClass.cs and SMLeftIdleSprite.cs).
		Thus, the cameraPositionY will decrease the cohesion of Camera.cs.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
		Now, we can delete the cameraPositionY since it is useless. However, if we want to add new features of the camera if the future, it is a good idea to
	keep the cameraPositionY as an option. For example, if want the Mario to fly, the camera must follow Mario's movement and move up and down then the 
	cameraPositionY could become useful.
