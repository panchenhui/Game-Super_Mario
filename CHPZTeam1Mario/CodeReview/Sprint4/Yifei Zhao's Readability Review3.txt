The overall readability of this class is good. The number of variable is large but the name of variable is reasonable. The readability of variables is good.
Every method name is the same as mario class since it is a decorated class. And the method name is clear. The timer logic is a little bit tricky but it is not 
so hard to understand. Therefore, this class has good code readability.
