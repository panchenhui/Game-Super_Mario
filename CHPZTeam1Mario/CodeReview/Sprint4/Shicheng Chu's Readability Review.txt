Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
	In BFTakeDamageMario.cs, Haoqi Hu took lots of if-else clauses in the constructor, which is difficult to understand how it construct a BFTakeDamageMario and what the functionality
	a BFTakeDamageMario has. Yifei Zhao's Enum.cs is helpful to solve such problem. Maybe we can add more enum in the Enum.cs and revise Sprite Class's fields to make our code more 
	readable. Also, in each Collision Handler class, we have lots of magic numbers, we can also use enum so reduce magic numbers.
