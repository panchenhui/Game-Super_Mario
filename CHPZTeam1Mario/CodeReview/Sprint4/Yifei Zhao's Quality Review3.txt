BrickWithItemsClass.cs
Code Quality:
The overall quality of this class is good. The Update method is a little long but comparing to its functionality, every code here
is necessary. Also, many variable like counter and timer were used in this class. These variables increase the logic complexity
of the code, but it will not increase the coupling problem. Thus, it is acceptable. These class has good cohesion and low coupling. 
The only coupling problem is the Enum class, but it can help reduce magic number or strings. So, I thing this is ok.  

If some content is changed in this class, the only thing will happen is the behavior of brickblock objects in game. The game project
can deal with these changes.
