Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
The code is clear and simple,it's easy to understand. But some names of the files may be not proper, such as "SriteSMLeftIdle.cs", I think put the adjective word at the beginning of the name would be better, like StandingSMSprite.cs.

Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
Readable: The code clear and simple. The algorithm of the animation is also understandable.
Some variable names are not very understandable, such as width and height, when I saw them at the first glance, I didn't know it's whose width or whose height.
