PipeSprite.cs
Code Quality:
The readabilty of the code is good. All the method and variable name is in the same pattern of group and it is easily read.
The code is low coupling and high cohesion. Thus, this code is in good maintainability and reusability. This class only deal with the sprite of pipe,
so whenever need to change the content of the code, the only thing need to do is to add method or change coordinates values.

The code is capable of being changed when the game need to be change. The size of the pipe can be changed by changing the X Y coordinnate of the rectangle.
The speed of frames of the annimation can also be changed by changing the speed variable.
