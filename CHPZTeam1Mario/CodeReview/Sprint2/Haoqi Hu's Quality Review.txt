Specific comments on code quality:
All these code are in very low cohension. We used a lot of states in this program,
and most of the code in State file is very similar, just change the names of specific
states. We could reduce the complexity of these code by using abstract class and let 
the .cs files in State file extends it.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and 
how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
For example, let's say if we create an abstract class called MarioStateAction, which
implements the Crouch,Stand,Jump,Walk and Dead actions of MarioState. In that way, we
need to change the States file completely. That is a huge amount of work, and that is
why these codes are in low maintainability.
