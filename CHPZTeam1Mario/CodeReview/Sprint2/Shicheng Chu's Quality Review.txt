Specific comments on code quality:
		For EnemySpriteFactory.cs, the only purpose is to create sprite sheet of enemies such as Goomba 
	and Koopa and there is no unnecessary variable, filed or function. Thus, the cohesion for this 
	factory class is in high cohesion. Also, it just uses one other class, so it is in loose coupling.
	It is easy for us to add new method to create sprite sheet for new kinds of enemies. However, it could only
	be used to create sprite sheet for enemies and cannot be used to create sprite sheet for blocks and Mario since
	it only loads one enemy sprite sheet.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
		If we want to create a new kind of enemy but this new one does not show on the "enemies" picture, we must add a new variable of Texture2D and load it in the 
		LoadAllTexure method. It is easy to add these codes.
